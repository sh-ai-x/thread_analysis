# Behavior by environment:
#   - GitHub Actions (GITHUB_REF set): warn-only `::warning::` annotation on direct push to main
#   - Manual: print policy text and exit 0
#
# Active enforcement lives in `.githooks/pre-push` (client-side git hook).
# This script provides the warn-only server-side mirror so CI sees the same policy.
