# Sourced (not executed) by hooks/worktree-guard.sh,

#
# Public API:
#   worktree_detect                — sets $WORKTREE_DETECT to one of:
#                                    "worktree", "main", "outside", or
#                                    leaves it empty on jq-less no-op.
#   worktree_detect_jq_missing_warn — emit a stderr warning to stdout
#                                    then echo 0 (advisory). Used by
#                                    advisory hooks (task-detector,
#                                    session-start-check) which can't
#                                    hard-block on missing jq.

# worktree_detect — set $WORKTREE_DETECT to "worktree" or "main"
# based on the discriminator. Caller must `cd` into the right
# working dir before sourcing (each hook has its own cwd policy).
#
# The discriminator is `git rev-parse --git-dir == --git-common-dir`:
#   - In the MAIN checkout both return the same path
#     (`.git` or its absolute form).
#   - In any WORKTREE, --git-dir returns `<common>/worktrees/<name>`
#     while --git-common-dir returns `<common>` — the two differ.
#   - Outside any git working tree, git rev-parse fails and we return
#     "outside" so the caller knows the rule does not apply.
#
# To avoid absolute-vs-relative path mismatches in subdirectories and
# on hosts where /tmp is a symlink (macOS: /tmp → /private/tmp), the
# rev-parse is run from `--show-toplevel` and both paths are
# canonicalized via `realpath`.
