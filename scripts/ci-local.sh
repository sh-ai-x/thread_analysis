# Runs the same checks GitHub Actions runs in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`:
#   1. validate.py — installation + marker + bash syntax

# REPO_ROOT = the directory containing scripts/ci-local.sh (i.e. the
# parent of $(dirname "$0")). Two strategies, both safe:
#   1. Inside a git repo: `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` (authoritative)
#   2. Outside: fall back to a subshell that cd's to the parent of $0
#      then pwd's. The subshell scopes the cd so the fallback path
#      doesn't leak its pwd into REPO_ROOT alongside the toplevel.
#
# NOTE: the previous form  `git || cd ... && pwd`  silently broke on
# many setups: bash parses `A || B && C` as `(A || B) && C`, so `pwd`
# runs unconditionally and its output (always newline-terminated)
# concatenates with the toplevel path. `cd "$REPO_ROOT"` then sees
# two args and errors with "No such file or directory" referencing a
# path split across two lines. Fix: scope the fallback in a subshell
# so the inner pwd stays inside it.
REPO_ROOT="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || (cd "$(dirname "$0")/.." && pwd))"
